JAVA DIRECTORY POLLER

This is a java applet which polls a directory for new files. The first new 
File detected will be uploaded via http to a cgi script (as multipart-mime).

The applet requires elevated privileges on the client computer and must 
therefore be signed (or the java security must be reduced, not recomended.
This will probably not work in future versions of java).

Building
--------

The build system used is gnu make. 

For signing, building and creating a keystore a password is required. This 
must be set as environment variable PASS (eg. bash$ export PASS=secret). If the 
env variable is missing, the signing process will fail. If you cannot use 
environment variables, you might edit the Makefile and replace '$$PASS' with 
your password.  

1) You first need to create a keystore if you don't have one
   $ export PASS=secret; make keytool

2) building the applet is as simple as
   $ make
   if everything works, you will get a self-signed
   upload.jar i nthe current directory

Deploying
---------

add an applet tag to your site. The applet provides LiveConnect capabilities.
This means that you can acces properties of the java class 'upload' fom 
within your page via JavaScript. It also means that the Java applet will
emit certain events which you can catch easily by just defining a couple 
of javascript functions. If these functions are present, they will be called 
from within the applet.

This is an example tag (snippet):
	<applet id="upload"
	        code="upload.class" 
	        archive="upload.jar"
	        width="0" 
	        height="0">
		<param name="dir" value="/tmp" />
		<param name="name" value="scan" />
		<param name="target" value="http://localhost/post.php" />
	</applet>

post.php should be part of this distribution and shows what can be expected to
be posted by the applet.
